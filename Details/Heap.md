Difference between Min Heap and Max Heap:
 
1.

In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be less than or equal to among the keys present at all of its children.

In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greater than or equal to among the keys present at all of its children.

2.

In a Min-Heap the minimum key element is present at the root.

In a Max-Heap the maximum key element is present at the root.

3.

A Min-Heap uses the ascending priority.

A Max-Heap uses the descending priority.

4.

In the construction of a Min-Heap, the smallest element has priority.

In the construction of a Max-Heap, the largest element has priority.

5.

In a Min-Heap, the smallest element is the first to be popped from the heap.

In a Max-Heap, the largest element is the first to be popped from the heap.
