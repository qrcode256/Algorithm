### **Basics of Bit Manipulation**
 
Understanding the core bitwise operators is essential for solving bit manipulation problems.

- **AND (`&`)**: Masks bits, used to clear bits or check specific bits.
- **OR (`|`)**: Sets specific bits in a number.
- **XOR (`^`)**: Flips bits when two bits are different, used for toggling bits or checking equality.
- **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all bits.
- **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Multiplies by powers of two.
- **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Divides by powers of two.
- **Key Concept**: Understanding how these operators work on binary representations of numbers.

### **Power of Two Checks**
- To check if a number `n` is a power of two, use `n & (n - 1)`. If the result is `0`, itâ€™s a power of two. Powers of two have only one bit set in their binary representation.

### **Counting Set Bits**
- Use `x &= (x - 1)` to remove the lowest set bit and keep counting until `x == 0`. This helps count the number of 1's (set bits) in the binary representation. Each `x &= (x - 1)` removes the lowest set bit, making it ideal for counting bits.

### 4. **Swapping Numbers Using XOR**

You can swap two numbers `x` and `y` without using a temporary variable with the following operations:
```
  1. `x = x ^ y`
  2. `y = x ^ y`
  3. `x = x ^ y`
```
XORing a number with itself results in 0, so swapping can be done in-place without using additional space.

### 5. **Reversing Bits**
Reversing the bits of a number involves extracting each bit and shifting it into its reverse position.

By shifting bits one at a time and using bitwise OR, you can reverse the order of bits in a number.
